\vspace{0.4cm}
\noindent$\bullet$ \enspace \textbf{Comment 3:}
\textit{The motivation on lines 42–45 is a bit misleading, I think. If one sets the viscosity to an extremely high level, near-rigidity can indeed be achieved. Rather, the issue is that viscosity by itself penalizes only the deformation rate and not the degree of deformation, i.e., no elastic effects are available. }

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
Thank you very much for your professional review. We agree with your perspective. Under the premise of ensuring numerical stability, it is indeed possible to achieve "rigidity" by setting the viscosity to a very high value. However, as you said, the real issue lies in the fact that viscosity only penalizes the rate of deformation, not the degree of deformation. Therefore, a fluid with extremely high viscosity will exhibit "creeping flow" rather than true "solid-like" behaviour. Thanks to your comments, we will make the necessary corrections to our discussion as follows:

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Revised text:}

\revised{
	However, these methods are limited by viscous stress. Regardless of how large the viscous stress is, it solely influences the deformation rate and not the degree of deformation, meaning that elastic effects are not expected. Therefore, the non-Newtonian material produced by this method may not truly be “solid-like”.

\vspace{0.4cm}
\noindent$\bullet$ \enspace \textbf{Comment 8:}
\textit{It's a bit unclear to me what "the confinement of elasticity" means. }

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
We apologize for the confusing description. In fact, what is meant here is that the final effect of plasticity could be seen as a "confinement" of the elastic stress. Generally speaking, when the strain exceeds the yield point, plasticity starts to take effect and follows a plastic constitutive model. The rate of stress growth at this stage will be slower than the rate of stress growth at the elastic stage. Specifically, in the simplified plastic model used in this paper, the stress no longer increases beyond the yield point (represented by a horizontal line, as shown in Fig.~3 of the paper). Therefore, we said that "Plasticity can be thought of as the confinement of elasticity."

Thanks for your kind suggestion. Given that the specific meaning conveyed by this sentence has been detailed in the subsequent text, its repetition seems redundant. Thus, we've decided to remove it from the updated manuscript.

\textit{What are the definitions of the "startup region" and "ending region"?}

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
We are sorry for the misunderstanding, which was caused by the omission of a figure. We have supplemented this figure (Fig. 6 in the paper) to explain the viscosity-shear-rate curve. In this figure, the curve is divided into three parts: the start-up region, the middle region, and the ending region. It can be clearly seen that the start-up region and ending region gradually approach the horizontal line when the shear rate is near zero or near infinity. Such a curve is more in agreement with what is observed in real-world. Thus, we claim that the Cross model and the Carreau model “improves the fitting of the start-up region and the ending region” in our manuscript. The additional figure is shown as follows:


\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Revised text:}

\revised{As shown in Fig. 6, the curve representing the relationship between viscosity and shear rate exhibits a reverse-S shape.}

\revised{
	The Carreau model and the Cross model simulate shear-thinning behaviors. At low and high shear rates, the constitutive curves tend to be horizontal.

Thank you for your kind suggestion. We apologize for any confusion caused. In the revised manuscript, we will replace the ambiguous references with the specific names of the frameworks, i.e., FLIP and MPM.

The related experiments in the video will also be updated accordingly.

\textit{How is cutting actually performed? Presumably the particles need to be at least some minimum distance apart for them not to interact? Does cutting push them apart? Or does the cutting tool block them from communicating? Otherwise removing the cutting tool would allow them to reconnect and then fail to separate. }

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
Thank you for the comments. Actually, we insert the cut board into the chocolate bunny. This cut board is also composed of particles and has a certain thickness. So your guess is correct. The inserted cut board causes the particles in the chocolate bunny to separate, which makes the particles travel further than the neighbourhood search threshold, producing the separating effect. To give readers a better understanding, we added the following explanation to our revised manuscript:

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Revised text:}

\revised{
The cutting phenomenon is realized by the insertion of the cutting board, which is composed of particles and has a certain thickness. The board divides the bunny particles to disperse, leading them to travel beyond the neighbourhood search threshold, thereby creating the separating effect.}

\vspace{0.4cm}
\noindent$\bullet$ \enspace \textbf{Comment 18:}
\textit{ The motion of the liquid surface at the time of impact in the golf ball test looks a bit odd to me. Perhaps it is the rendering, but I cannot quite tell what is happening around that time. A slow motion visualization might be helpful to clarify?  }

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
Thank you for the comments. We apologize for the confusion caused. At the moment of collision, there is a sudden increase in shear rate, which causes an immediate surge in viscosity within the collision region. Consequently, the ball does not drop right away. However, this process is relatively short-lived. Following this, the ball gradually begins to sink. This is due to the fact that the shear rate reverts to a lower level, causing the viscosity to also return to a lower level. Thus, under the influence of gravity, the ball starts to sink slowly, beginning at a lower velocity. As you suggested, we have slowed down the collision moment (0.2X speed) in the video and re-rendered the variation of shear rate to provide better clarity.

% ----------------------------- reviewer 1 comment 19 ---------------------------- %

\vspace{0.4cm}
\noindent$\bullet$ \enspace \textbf{Comment 19:}
\textit{I could not understand quite what the comment about tree trunk particles and meadow particles was talking about (p8, right column). The last paragraph before section 6 seems to emphasize AR/VR. Is this just a hold-over from the earlier submission to an AR/VR conference? Should this be removed/modified? Also same later in Section 6.  }

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
We apologize for the confusion. As per your comments, we realize that the VR painting experiment has less business with our non-Newtonian framework. Per your suggestion above, the VR-related content and experiments have been deleted in our revised version.

\vspace{0.4cm}
\noindent$\bullet$ \enspace \textbf{Comment 1:}
\textit{I first thought it was nice that the authors introduce the Generalized Maxwell Model (GMM) shown in Fig. 2, which is (to the best of my knowledge) not very popular in the graphics community yet. However, I could not find a suitable reference to the GMM model in the manuscript. I just noticed the GMM model is rather popular for viscoelasticity without plasticity. I am not sure if the presented one is the well-known GMM or an adapted model for plasticity. The presented model looks similar to the visco-elasto-plasticity model proposed by [Fang et al. 2019]. The author should clarify this.}


\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
Thank you very much for your valuable comments.
Our GMM model is an 'adapted model for plasticity' that has been modified by ourselves. As you rightly pointed out, GMM is primarily used for viscoelastic materials. We drew inspiration from the ideas presented by Fang et al.~\cite{Fang2019-sillyRubber}. In addition, we have expanded their GMM model by incorporating plasticity, enabling us to handle a variety of non-Newtonian behaviors.

As per what you suggested, we have added the following text to point out the origin of the GMM concept.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Added text:}

\revised{We present a Generalized Maxwell Model to describe the constitutive relation underlying our unified non-Newtonian framework. Our inspiration is from the similar model from Fang et al.[32] for viscoelasticity simulation.}



% ----------------------------- reviewer 2 comment 2 ---------------------------- %

\vspace{0.4cm}
\noindent$\bullet$ \enspace \textbf{Comment 2:}
\textit{The performance comparisons with FLIP and MPM need further clarification. Both FLIP and MPM are hybrid methods, which use both grid and particles. The grid information, which is an important factor for their performance, is missing; thus, I was not fully convinced of the performance superiority of the proposed method. }


\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
Thank you for your comments. We agree with your viewpoint. With regard to performance comparisons, our non-Newtonian framework indeed does not showcase superior performance. As we acknowledged in the Limitations Section, we did not specifically optimize for performance. To make a more fair comparison, we recognize the need to reconfigure the performance experiments. Consequently, in the updated manuscript, we introduced a new comparison for the Honey and Toy Cow scenes. We kept the particle count roughly the same and came to the same conclusion: for visco-elastic-plastic behavior simulation, our method is roughly equivalent to FLIP and superior to MPM; for viscous behavior simulation, our method has the best efficiency. Overall, our method has the relatively highest cost performance as it could cover more phenomena while maintaining acceptable efficiency.
Thanks so much for your kind suggestion to make experiments more rigorous and convincing. We have made adjustments to the relevant discussion.

The new performance table is as follows:

\textit{In the Honey (Fig. 7) example, the authors claim that the compared MPM does not achieve the desired high-viscous behavior despite being known to support high-viscous materials. It would be better to elaborate more on why this was the case in the presented test. I am wondering if it is a boundary handling issue, material parameter issue, simulation resolution issue, or something else. }


\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
Thank you for your helpful comments. We apologize for the inaccuracy of this comparison experiment. We have re-simulated the scene, and this time we obtained consistent viscous effect among these three methods (as shown in the following figure and Fig. 8 in our revised paper). Furthermore, we have constrained the number of particles to a uniform level (all at 13.8K). After the re-simulation, we found that FLIP takes 0.06s per frame, our SPH takes 0.04s, while MPM takes 11.6s. Therefore, the conclusion remains unchanged: our framework performs on par with FLIP and both outperform MPM.

\textit{In the Armadillos (Fig. 12) example, it is nice to see such a large variety of different models. On the other hand, however, it is less intuitive regarding what kinds of materials/behaviors are intended. It would be better to elaborate to give a more intuitive explanation of such different models.  }

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
Thank you for your suggestion. We have added the following text to give an intuitive explanation for armadillos example as you suggested.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Added text:}

\revised{In this experiment, we evaluate seven distinct viscosity models that are related to shear rate. The viscosity models depicted in Fig.~14 include Carreau, Casson, Cross, PowerLaw2 (shear-thickening), PowerLaw1 (shear-thinning), Newtonian, Herschel-Bulkley, and Bingham models. These models can be classified into four categories: 1) Shear-thinning behaviors, which include Carreau, Cross, and PowerLaw1; 2) Shear-thickening behavior, primarily represented by PowerLaw2; 3) Bingham behavior, including Herschel-Bulkley, Bingham, and Casson; and 4) Newtonian behavior~\cite{Chhabra2010,Phan2017}}.

%\revised{It's important to note that the PowerLaw model can be subdivided into PowerLaw1 (shear-thinning) and PowerLaw2 (shear-thickening). This is because adjusting the parameter $n$ can emulate various non-Newtonian behaviors, such as shear-thinning ($n<1$) and shear-thickening ($n>1$). }

\revised{As shown in Fig.~14, it's clear that PowerLaw2 (shear-thickening) exhibits the optimal flowability. This is due to the fact that it simulates shear-thickening behavior, where viscosity escalates with the increase of shear rate. In our experiment, the high-viscosity fluid begins flowing from zero velocity under the influence of gravity, at a relatively low shear rate. At low shear rates, the viscosity remains low. }

\revised{In contrast, PowerLaw1 (shear-thinning) exhibits the least flowability. This is due to its simulation of shear-thinning behavior under the same parameters as PowerLaw2 (with the exception of $n$). Consequently, at low shear rate, the viscosity remains high.}

%\revised{The Bingham model demonstrates moderate flowability, similar to the Newtonian model. The defining feature of the Bingham model is that the fluid exhibits rigidity until the yield point is surpassed. Beyond that, its behavior aligns with that of a typical Newtonian fluid. For the Bingham model, the stress-strain curve beyond the yield point mirrors that of the Newtonian model.}
%\revised{It is important to note that the concept of Bingham behavior mentioned in this study is distinct from the Bingham model. The former refers to stress-strain curves with a yield point, while the latter specifically refers to the simplest model that simulates Bingham behavior, which exhibits Newtonian behavior once it exceeds the yield point.}
\revised{There are two models used for simulating Bingham behavior: the Herschel-Bulkley model and the Casson model. Beyond the yield point, the Herschel-Bulkley model adheres to PowerLaw behavior, which could manifest as shear-thinning, shear-thickening, or Newtonian. Consequently, it offers more flexibility and has a greater number of parameters. As demonstrated in Fig.~14, this model exhibits behavior similar to that of a Newtonian fluid. Conversely, the Casson model is only capable of simulating shear-thinning Bingham behavior. Therefore, in agreement with our analysis of PowerLaw1 (shear-thinning), the fluid flowability simulated by the Casson model is relatively poor at low shear rate.}

\revised{The Carreau model and the Cross model~\cite{Cross1965} are used to simulate shear-thinning behaviors. These two models are somewhat similar, with their stress-strain curves displaying a reverse S-shaped pattern. Specifically, at both low and high shear rates, the constitutive curves tend to level out. Therefore, even though both models are used to simulate shear-thinning behavior similar to PowerLaw1, the viscosity at low shear rates doesn't reach the high levels observed with PowerLaw1, resulting in moderate flowability.}

\revised{ To compare the shear-thinning and shear-thickening behaviors, we substitute the fluid with ketchup (a shear-thinning fluid) and a golf ball falls into ketchup, while retaining other setup parameters. We adapt its parameters from~\cite{Bottiglieri1991}, using a power law model (n=0.26, m=5.86, parameters can be found in Table~3). Due to its shear-thinning nature, the viscosity decreases at the moment of collision, resulting in a splashing effect.}

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
We apologize for any confusion caused. The discrepancy arises due to post-processing during rendering. In the simulation process, it isn't feasible or necessary to include golf balls with textured and uneven surfaces. Instead, we use a discretized sphere composed of particles for the actual simulation. During the rendering process, we replace the simulated sphere with a textured golf ball that has uneven surfaces. We feel sorry that there may be differences between the rendered ball's position and the actual simulation results.
Thanks to your careful review, we have implemented adjustments to our rendering in the updated video.

\noindent$\bullet$ \enspace \textbf{Comment 1:}
\textit{First, I do not really understand the emphasis on the fact, that the concept is a "unified" particle approach. I basically see one material and particles are used in the discretization. I do not see that there would be the option of a non-unified particle approach for this one material in contrast to the advertised unified approach. }


\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
Thank your very much for your careful review and helpful comments. We feel quite sorry about confusion caused by the use of the word "unified". In simple terms, "unified" means that we are combining all non-Newtonian behaviors (viscous, elastic, and plastic) in a framework.

In our literature review, we found that there are few existing methods specifically designed for studying non-Newtonian behaviors. Technically speaking, any behavior that doesn't adhere to the Newtonian shear law is classified as non-Newtonian. However, this definition is expansive and nebulous. Resorting to the rheological definition falls short of the requirements for visual effects in computer graphics. According to our analysis, the key to showcasing the visual effect of non-Newtonian behaviors lies in demonstrating the material’s dynamic characteristics ranging from fluid-like to solid-like. Therefore, a simulation algorithm needs to consider the following key features: 1) variable viscosity (encompassing classical shear-related models), 2) the incorporation of elasticity, and 3) the inclusion of plasticity.

%Existing research rarely covers all of the above points. Early works such as Carlson~\cite{Carlson2002} and Stora~\cite{Stora1999} considered classical shear-related variable viscosity models. Zhu~\cite{Zhu2015-nonNewton} is one of the few papers dedicated to simulating non-Newtonian behaviors, considering variable viscosity and elasticity. However, it only provides one shear-related variable viscosity model and lacks plasticity simulation. In recent years, some works using Material Point Method (MPM) claim to be capable of simulating non-Newtonian behaviors, such as Su~\cite{Su2021} and Fang~\cite{Fang2019-sillyRubber}. However, their methods are only focused on viscoelastic behavior. Solenthaler~\cite{Solenthaler2009-PCISPH} proposed a unified SPH-based approach that could simulate both fluids and solids, but it did not specifically address viscoelastic materials in-between fluids and solids. Goktekin~\cite{Goktekin2004} simulated semi-fluid, semi-solid materials by adding elastic stress in the momentum equation, which provided us some inspiration. Our elastic approach is inspired by Becker~\cite{Becker2009}, and the plasticity approach is inspired by O'Brien~\cite{OBrien2002}. However, these are individual works. 
In the field of computer graphics, we have not seen specialized research that covers the majority of non-Newtonian behaviors, despite the fact that non-Newtonian behaviors are widely present in real-world phenomena. Therefore, we believe that there is a need for an approach that unifies the three aforementioned behavioral characteristics.
Thanks to your valuable comment, to avoid the potential confusion of readers, we have supplemented the explanation in our revised manuscript as follows:

Existing research seldom covers all of the above-mentioned research issues. Early works, such as Carlson et al.~\cite{Carlson2002} and Stora et al.~\cite{Stora1999}, considered classical shear-related variable viscosity models.

\textit{My second point would be about the experiments. The paper presents numerous experiments and analyses, which is definitely sufficient for a publication. On the other hand, I am wondering, wether a short discussion of extreme cases for the parameterization of the material model might be interesting. This could also be seen as a discussion of limitations.  }


\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
Thank you for your comments. We wholeheartedly agree with your perspective, as in-depth discussion and analysis will undoubtedly enhance the quality of our article. In numerous instances, extreme parameter choices may culminate in non-convergent results. For example, excessively quick changes in viscosity and overly large values of the elastic modulus might lead to such outcomes. Some scenarios result in numerical explosions right from the outset, while others encounter such issues midway. The numerical explosions are likely due to abrupt variations in certain parameters. For instance, the moment the golf ball collides with the fluid in the falling golf ball scenario can trigger a sudden change in viscosity, resulting in a breakdown. Similarly, in the case of a falling elastic tomato, if the elastic modulus is set too high, the program will crash immediately. We speculate that these extreme situations may be linked to numerical stiffness issues. Therefore, a stable viscosity and elastoplastic solver may be the key to resolving these problems. We anticipate further and much more in-depth explorations of the aforementioned topics will occur in the near future. 

As per your suggestion, we have added the following paragraph in the Section Limitation:

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Added text:}

\revised{We also observed that unreasonable extreme parameters may lead to the non-convergence of numerical simulations. For example, rapidly changing viscosity and excessively large elastic modulus can cause issues such as numerical explosion. 
%Some examples result in numerical explosions from the beginning, while others may experience a numerical explosion in the middle. The occurrence of a explosion in the middle is likely due to sharp variations in certain parameters. 
For instance, the moment the golf ball collides with the fluid in the falling golf ball scenario will trigger a sudden change in viscosity, which may result in a breakdown. Similarly, in the case of a falling elastic tomato, if the elastic modulus is set extremely high, the program will crash immediately.

\textit{The main contribution of this paper is incremental and inspiring. The implementation of unified solver collects previous known models and incorporated it. I am glad to see different non-Newtonian simulation can be done in one framework. However, as I mentioned above, the necessity of a unified solve is not clearly demonstrated. The author should discuss this in the revised version.}



\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
Thank you for comments. As per you suggested, we realized that explaining and emphasizing the necessity of “a unified solve” is very important.

Some of the existing researches focus on the individual performance of non-Newtonian behaviors, such as Carlson et al.~\cite{Carlson2002} and Stora et al.~\cite{Stora1999}, considered classical shear-related variable viscosity models. Zhu et al.~\cite{Zhu2015-nonNewton} took into account variable viscosity and elasticity, it offers only one shear-related variable viscosity model and does not include plasticity simulation. Su et al.~\cite{Su2021} and Fang et al.~\cite{Fang2019-sillyRubber} simulated non-Newtonian behaviors with the popular MPM model. However, their methods primarily concentrate on viscoelastic behavior. Solenthaler et al.~\cite{Solenthaler2009-PCISPH} proposed a unified SPH-based approach capable of simulating both fluids and solids, but it did not specifically address viscoelastic materials that fall between fluids and solids. Goktekin~\cite{Goktekin2004} simulated semi-fluid, semi-solid materials by incorporating elastic stress into the momentum equation. 

Despite the wide prevalence of non-Newtonian behaviors in real-world phenomena, we have yet to see specialized computer graphics research that could encompass the various non-Newtonian behaviors in a unified solver. The challenges remain that non-Newtonian key features (variable viscosity, incorporation of elasticity, inclusion of plasticity) can hardly coordinate and synchronize in a seamless manner.   
 Therefore, we believe that a flexible but unified framework, which allows for the coupling of these features, would be a significant and useful addition to the computer graphics research.

Per your valuable comments above, we have added the explanation in our revised manuscript:

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Response:}
Thank you for pointing out the problem. Indeed, this trembling does exist. We observed this trembling phenomenon in cases involving a large number of particles (over 100K). However, it is not apparent in smaller-scale simulations (1K to 10K). Initially, we speculated that this is due to insufficient rigidity resulting from parameter settings, and made some modifications accordingly. However, after conducting multiple tests, we found it challenging to adjust the parameters in a way that completely eradicated the trembling. Later, we conjectured that this trembling might be inherent to particle-based elastic simulations themselves. Since particles are only locally connected through neighborhood searches, the information they store is limited to their immediate surroundings. %Moreover, in comparison with the mesh-based methods, particle-based methods have more degrees of freedom, which increases with the number of particles. Therefore, we suspect that the SPH method itself may be the cause of the trembling. 
Thanks to your kind reminder, we will address this point in our paper.
